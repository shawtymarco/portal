## Overview

**Portal** is a transfer proxy written in Go that allows Bedrock Edition players to seamlessly move between multiple backend servers — regardless of what server software each one runs. Players connect to Portal once, and transfers between servers happen instantly without disconnecting.

This build targets Minecraft Bedrock protocol **1001** with game version **1.26.30**.

Portal supports any combination of backend server software through its TCP socket API:

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Library | Type | Engine | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **PocketMine-MP** (PHP) | [PortalPM](https://github.com/MEMOxiiii/PortalPM) | Plugin | [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) | ✅ Supported |
| **Dragonfly** (Go) | [PortalDF](https://github.com/MEMOxiiii/PortalDF) | Library | [Dragonfly](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly) | ✅ Supported |
| **GeyserMC** (Java) | [Portal-GeyserMC](https://github.com/MEMOxiiii/Portal-GeyserMC) | Extension | [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/) 2.9.5+ | ✅ Supported |
| **NukkitX / PowerNukkitX** (Java) | — | Plugin | [NukkitX](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Nukkit) / [PowerNukkitX](https://github.com/PowerNukkitX/PowerNukkitX) | 🔜 Coming Soon |
| **EndstoneMC** (BDS) | — | Plugin | [Endstone](https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone) (BDS) | ⚠️ Experimental ¹ |

> ¹ **EndstoneMC (BDS):** We will attempt to support Endstone in future releases, but we cannot guarantee full compatibility due to BDS limitations. In the meantime, you can use **[GeyserMC](https://github.com/MEMOxiiii/Portal-GeyserMC)** as an alternative to connect BDS-based servers to the Portal network.

## Features

- **Zero-downtime Transfers** — Players switch servers instantly without disconnects
- **Multi-platform** — Mix PocketMine, Dragonfly, GeyserMC (and more) servers on the same network
- **TCP Socket API** — Simple binary protocol for integrating any server software
- **Resource Packs** — Serve resource packs from the proxy level
- **Resource Pack Hot Reload** — Reload proxy resource packs for new connections without restarting Portal
- **Whitelist** — Built-in whitelist support
- **Latency Reporting** — Real-time player latency tracking sent to backend servers
- **Event Bus** — Subscribe to player join/quit, server register/unregister and transfer events via `Portal.Events()` without forking the proxy
- **Admin Console** — `players`, `servers`, `kick`, `transfer` and `drain` commands from stdin, no restart required
- **Clustering** — Optional Redis-backed presence sharing so `FindPlayerRequest` can resolve players connected to a different proxy in the same network
- **Server Groups & Draining** — Route players into named server pools with fallback chains, and drain a server ahead of a restart without dropping it from the registry
- **Health Checking** — Real RakNet pings catch servers that are registered but hung or crashed, automatically pulling them out of (and back into) load balancing
- **Weighted Load Balancing** — Give servers of different capacity a different share of new players; defaults to a plain even split if you never set it, so it works the same whether you run one server or fifty
- **IP Guard** — Static IP bans and per-IP connection rate limiting at the player listener
- **Metrics** — Optional Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint for player counts, transfers and socket clients
- **Graceful Shutdown** — Clean disconnects and listener shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- **Lightweight** — Minimal resource footprint, written in Go

## Socket Protocol

Portal communicates with backend servers via a binary TCP protocol:

- **Frame:** 4-byte little-endian length prefix + payload
- **Packet Header:** 2-byte little-endian packet ID
- **Strings:** Varuint32 length prefix + UTF-8 bytes
- **UUIDs:** 16 bytes (big-endian)
- **Integers:** Little-endian

### Packet Types

| ID | Packet | Direction | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `0x00` | AuthRequest | Server → Proxy | Authenticate with secret |
| `0x01` | AuthResponse | Proxy → Server | Authentication result |
| `0x02` | RegisterServer | Server → Proxy | Register server name + address |
| `0x03` | TransferRequest | Server → Proxy | Request player transfer |
| `0x04` | TransferResponse | Proxy → Server | Transfer result |
| `0x05` | PlayerInfoRequest | Server → Proxy | Query player XUID/IP |
| `0x06` | PlayerInfoResponse | Proxy → Server | Player info result |
| `0x07` | ServerListRequest | Server → Proxy | Request all servers |
| `0x08` | ServerListResponse | Proxy → Server | List of servers + counts |
| `0x09` | FindPlayerRequest | Server → Proxy | Find player on network |
| `0x0A` | FindPlayerResponse | Proxy → Server | Player location result |
| `0x0B` | UpdatePlayerLatency | Proxy → Server | Player latency update |
| `0x0C` | SetServerDraining | Server → Proxy | Mark/unmark the server as draining for load balancing |

`RegisterServer` also carries `Group` (string) and `Weight` (uint32, 0 treated as 1) fields. Servers
registering with the same group name are treated as a pool by a `GroupedLoadBalancer` (see
`routing.default_group`/`routing.fallback_groups` above), and within a pool, `SplitLoadBalancer` and
`GroupedLoadBalancer` both balance new players in proportion to `Weight` — a server with twice the weight of
another gets roughly twice the players before being considered equally loaded. Leaving `Weight` at its
default keeps a plain even split, so this is opt-in whether you're running a single server or a large fleet
of mixed-capacity machines.

A draining server (set via `SetServerDraining`) or a server currently failing health checks (see
`health_check.*` above) is skipped by both load balancers when picking a server for a newly joining player,
while players already on it are unaffected — useful for taking a server out of rotation ahead of a restart,
or for automatically routing around one that's hung or crashed.

`FindPlayerResponse` also carries a `Proxy` field, populated when `cluster.enabled` is set and the player
was found on a *different* proxy instance via the shared Redis backend rather than this proxy's local
session store. Clustering only answers "is this player online, and where" across proxies — it does not
implement proxy-to-proxy transfer routing, so a backend server still needs its own way to act on a remote
result (e.g. relaying a message rather than attempting to transfer the player directly).

## Quick Start Example

Here's a minimal example using the Portal Go library:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/paroxity/portal"
    "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
    log := logrus.New()
    
    p, err := portal.New(portal.DefaultConfig(), log)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create portal: %v", err)
    }
    
    defer p.Close()
    
    // Portal is now running and accepting connections
    select {}
}
```

## Event Bus

`Portal.Events()` exposes a proxy-wide event bus you can subscribe to without forking the proxy:

```go
p.Events().Subscribe(event.TopicPlayerJoin, func(payload any) {
    p := payload.(event.PlayerPayload)
    log.Infof("%s joined the network", p.Name)
})

p.Events().Subscribe(event.TopicTransfer, func(payload any) {
    t := payload.(event.TransferPayload)
    if t.Err != nil {
        log.Errorf("%s failed to transfer from %s to %s: %v", t.PlayerName, t.FromServer, t.ToServer, t.Err)
    }
})
```

Available topics: `TopicPlayerJoin`, `TopicPlayerQuit`, `TopicServerRegistered`, `TopicServerUnregistered`, `TopicTransfer`, `TopicServerHealthChanged`.

## Admin Console

The bundled binary reads admin commands from stdin while it runs:

| Command | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `help` | List available commands |
| `players` | List online players and the server each is connected to |
| `servers` | List registered servers, their group, weight, player count, draining and health state |
| `kick <player> [reason]` | Disconnect a player |
| `transfer <player> <server>` | Transfer a player to another registered server |
| `drain <server> [on\|off]` | Mark a server as draining (default `on`) so it stops receiving new players |

`Portal.HandleAdminCommand` and `Portal.ServeAdminConsole` are also available directly if you're embedding
Portal as a library and want to wire commands up to a different transport (e.g. an in-game `/portal` command
on a hub server).

## Client Libraries

Integrate your server with Portal using the appropriate library:

| Library | Language | Install |
|:---|:---|:---|
| [PortalPM](https://github.com/MEMOxiiii/PortalPM) | PHP | Drop plugin into `plugins/` |
| [PortalDF](https://github.com/MEMOxiiii/PortalDF) | Go | `go get github.com/MEMOxiiii/PortalDF` |
| [Portal-GeyserMC](https://github.com/MEMOxiiii/Portal-GeyserMC) | Java | Drop JAR into Geyser `extensions/` |
